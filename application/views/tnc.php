  <h2 class="main-title">Welcome to the <span>e-notes</span> Privacy Policy </h2>
  <div id="privacy-policy">
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>Posted: December 8, 2016</p>
      <p>Effective: February 10, 2017</p>

      <p>
          Thanks for using eNotes! Here we describe how we collect, use
  and handle your information when you use our websites, software and
  services ("<b>Services</b>").
      </p>
      <h2>What &amp; Why</h2>
      <p>
          We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:
      </p>

      <p>
          <em>Account</em>. We collect, and associate with your account,
  information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info,
  physical address, and account activity. Some of our services let you
  access your accounts and your information with other service providers.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Services</em>. Our Services are designed to make it simple
  for you to store Your Stuff, collaborate with others, and work across
  multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit
   Your Stuff—like files, messages, comments, and photos—as well as
  information related to it. This related information can be things like
  your profile information
   that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others.
  Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
          You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it
  easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send
   messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we'll store
   those contacts on our servers for you to use.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Usage</em>. We collect information related to how you use
  the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing,
  editing, viewing, and moving files or folders). This helps us provide
  you with features like the "Events" page and version history.
      </p>
      <p>
          We also collect information from and about the devices you use
  to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type
   of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming
  to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices
   (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to
   the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Cookies and other technologies</em>. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags
   to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example,
  cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next
   visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and
  improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to
  not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
   If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond
  to that signal as outlined
      <h2>With whom</h2>
      <p>
          We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Others working for eNotes</em>. eNotes uses certain
  trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT
   services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our
  Services. These third parties will access your information only to
  perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and
  we'll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our
  instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Other users</em>. Our Services display information like your
   name, profile picture, and email address to other users in places like
  your user profile and sharing notifications. When you register your
  eNotes account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer
   or organization, we may help collaborators find you and your team by
  making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile
   picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain.
  This helps us show you teams you can join, and helps other users share
  files and folders with you.
      </p>
      <p>
          Certain features let you make additional information available to others.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Other applications</em>. You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via eNotes APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>eNotes Team Admins.</em> If you are a user of a eNotes
  team (e.g., eNotes Business plans or eNotes Education), your
  administrator may have the ability to access and control your eNotes
  team account. Please refer to your organization's internal policies if
  you have questions about this. If you are not a eNotes team user but
  interact with a eNotes team user (by, for example, joining a shared
  folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that
  organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile
  picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the
  time of that interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. We may disclose your information to
  third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably
  necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death
  or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of eNotes or our
  users; or (d) protect eNotes's property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
          Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility
  that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same
   legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or
  on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for our users' data:

          </p><ul>
              <li>Be transparent,</li>
              <li>Fight blanket requests,</li>
              <li>Protect all users and</li>
              <li>Provide trusted services.</li>
          </ul>

          We publish a Transparency Report
   as part of our commitment to informing users about when and how
  governments ask us for information. This report details the types and
  numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage users
  to review our Government Request Principles and Transparency Report for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.
      <p></p>
      <h2>How</h2>
      <p>
          <em>Security</em>. We have a team dedicated to keeping your
  information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to
  work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things
  like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts
  when new devices and apps are linked to your account.
      </p>
      <p>
          <em>Retention</em>. We'll retain information you store on our
  Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you
  delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please
  note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from
  our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information
  if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or
  enforce our agreements. You can access your personal information by
  logging into your eNotes account.
      </p>

      <h2>Where</h2>
      <p>
          <em>Around the world</em>. To provide you with the Services, we
  may store, process and transmit information in the United States and
  locations around the world - including those outside your country.
  Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access
  the Services.
      </p>

      <p>
          <em>EU-US Privacy Shield and US-Swiss Safe Harbor.</em> When
  transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area,
  and Switzerland, eNotes relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms,
  including contracts with our users. eNotes complies with the U.S.-Swiss
   Safe Harbor ("<b>Safe Harbor</b>") framework and its principles. We also participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program ("<b>Privacy Shield</b>") and comply with its framework and principles. You can find eNotes's Safe Harbor certification and our Privacy Shield certification. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a> and Safe Harbor at <a target="_blank" href="http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/">http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          eNotes is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade
  Commission. JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible
  for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield and Safe
   Harbor compliance — free of charge to you. We ask that you first submit
   any such complaints directly to us via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:mcool4151@gmail.com">mcool4151@gmail.com</a>. If you aren't satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>.
   In the event your concern still isn't addressed by JAMS, you may be
  entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its
  principles.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
          If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or
  sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that
  deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email
  address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your
  choices in that event.
      </p>
      <p>
          We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will
  post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully
   reduces your rights, we will notify you.
